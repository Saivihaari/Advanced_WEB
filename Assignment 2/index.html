    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a highly skilled and motivated programmer, I have a strong passion for tackling complex challenges that require analytical thinking. During my undergraduate studies, I honed my problem-solving skills by working on various programming challenges from Geeks for Geeks. In particular, I extensively utilized C language to gain a deep understanding of how inbuilt functions work and how to effectively solve problems.</p>
      <p>After completing my undergraduate degree, I started my career as an intern at a startup before transitioning to a full-time role at Cognizant. At Cognizant, I expanded my knowledge base by learning .NET and working on an enhancement team for three months. My strong performance led to an opportunity to work in the SAP domain, where I gained valuable insights into how large corporations manage their data, goods, and services as well as their finances.</p>
      <p>However, after two years of working in this capacity, I recognized the importance of furthering my knowledge and skills in computer science. With this in mind, I made the decision to pursue a master’s degree in the United States, and I am now proud to be a graduate of UAB.</p>
      <p>As I embark on the next stage of my career, I am seeking an organization that will provide me with the opportunity to further develop my skills and knowledge, while also aligning with the organization's objectives. I am eager to bring my experience, technical expertise, and problem-solving skills to a dynamic and forward-thinking organization, and I look forward to contributing to its success.</p>
